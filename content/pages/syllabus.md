Class Description
-----------------

This class deals with the modeling and analysis of queueing systems, with applications in communications, manufacturing, computers, call centers, service industries and transportation. Topics include birth-death processes and simple Markovian queues, networks of queues and product form networks, single and multi-server queues, multi-class queueing networks, fluid models, adversarial queueing networks, heavy-traffic theory and diffusion approximations. The course will cover state of the art results which lead to research opportunities.

Course Requirements
-------------------

Bi-weekly problem sets, one in class mid-term, take home final and a MATLAB® computer project.

The project will consist of using MATLAB® to research some performance analysis questions. A written report on a project is due beginning of May. It is OK to form teams.
